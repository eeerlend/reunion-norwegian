# Reunion Mac - The norwegian free translation

NOTE!! This project is not fully translated yet, and should only be used experimental. You can contribute by forking it.

## Introduction
This is a translation of [Reunion](http://www.leisterpro.com) for norwegian users. The translation will follow the current GEDCOM standards as close as possible within the original software.

1. Download ZIP of this project
2. Copy the "Norwegian.lproj" folder into "/Applications/Reunion\ 11.app/Contents/Resources"
3. Restart Reunion and create a new family file.

It should now be localized into norwegian. Your old family file will not be translated by default, since the original translation follow the family file. If you want, you can import the old family file into the newly created one, to have it translated.
